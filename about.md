# Business, Philosophy, and AI

I have 10 years of experience in project and business management. The most significant project I did was co-founding a startup that grew to 300 employees, achieved annual sales revenue of USD 15m, and raised USD 10m. My last job was managing commercial development in two real-estate redevelopment projects for a private equity company, in which I closed contract with value of USD 37m.

Curiosity led me to the study of philosophy, grit awarded me a Masters degree. I'm interested in analytic philosophy and want to learn first-order logic and concepts of model theory so I can read more rigorous arguments one day. I consider myself a consequentialist and existentialist. My favorite philosophers are Zhuang Zi and David Hume, both have deep sense of humor.

I'm self-studying statistical learning and machine learning through reading and taking graduate courses through the Stanford Non-Degree program. I want more than just using packages as a black-box so I ended up learning it the hard way. My focus is on ML applications in healthcare, and bias problems.
