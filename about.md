June Chan is a student at Stanford through Non-Degree Option program. She is learning to write better code, and do better maths.

She is a business consultant and was VP Marketing for her last client. Before that, she cofounded and served as COO in a startup, which was funded by Alibaba (Riverhill Fund, Series A) and a South East Asia Airport fund (Series B).

June moved to San Francisco from Hong Kong in 2019. During the pandemic, she learned [how to make the perfect pizza dough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDpCzJw2xm4&list=PLPvoLJW0kOl8dtUWddvDvQfZWKlwwJXdX&index=2&t=0s).

She holds a M.Phil. in Philosophy. Her favorite philosopher is David Hume, only because of his English sense of humor.
